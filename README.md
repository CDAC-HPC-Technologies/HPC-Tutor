# HPC An Interactive Learning Platform

HPC Tutor is an A Unique Web-Enabled Platform for Facilitating Remote Hands-on High-Performance Computing (HPC) Training.

HPC Tutor solves a key challenge in online HPC education: the separation between lecture material and the shell environment. Our platform integrates learning content (PDFs, PPTs, videos) with direct terminal access to real HPC systems through a single, unified browser window. This allows students to learn concepts and immediately practice commands without switching contexts or managing complex logins, lowering the barrier to entry for future HPC practitioners.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Integrated Learning Environment:** View tutorials and run commands on integrated HPC resources side-by-side in a single browser tab
- **HPC-Focused Pedagogy:** Content tailored for students and researchers transitioning to supercomputing
- **Practical, Hands-On Exercises:** Direct, cloud-based, or on-prem HPC shell access for applied learning
- **Multi-Resource Integration:** Configure shells for multiple HPC facilities to meet diverse computing needs
- **Modular & Customizable:** Self-paced courses with beginner-to-advanced tiers. Easily customize content via Django CMS
- **Community-Driven:** We accept contributions for new tutorials, tools, and learning modules


## üì¶ Tech Stack

- Django CMS
- Bootstrap 3 & 5
- jQuery
- Apache or Gunicorn + Nginx (recommended for production)
